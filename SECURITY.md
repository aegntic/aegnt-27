### Security Considerations for aegnt-27

aegnt-27 is designed with security and privacy as core principles:

#### Privacy-First Architecture
- **Local Processing**: All authenticity processing happens locally by default
- **No Data Leakage**: Behavioral patterns are not transmitted to external servers
- **Encrypted Storage**: All persisted data uses AES-256 encryption
- **Memory Security**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory after use

#### Secure Defaults
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary system permissions
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Runs with minimal system access
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative defaults that prioritize security

#### Common Security Considerations

When using aegnt-27, be aware of:

1. **Binary Verification**: Always verify binary signatures before execution
2. **Configuration Security**: Protect configuration files with sensitive settings
3. **Network Security**: MCP server should run on localhost only in production
4. **Access Control**: Limit file system access to necessary directories only

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users
- Keep aegnt-27 updated to the latest version
- Use strong passwords for any encrypted configurations
- Run with minimal necessary permissions
- Monitor system resources for unexpected usage

#### For Developers
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs and outputs
- Use safe Rust patterns to prevent memory issues
- Implement proper error handling

#### For Enterprise Deployments
- Deploy behind proper firewalls
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Implement proper logging and audit trails
- Regular security assessments

### Known Security Considerations

#### Behavioral Analysis
- aegnt-27 analyzes user behavior patterns for authenticity
- This analysis happens locally and data is not transmitted
- Consider implications of behavioral modeling in your threat model

#### System Integration
- Mouse and keyboard monitoring requires system permissions
- Audio processing may access microphone (when enabled)
- Screen capture capabilities (for visual authenticity)

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate patch release
- **High**: Within 7 days
- **Medium**: Next minor release
- **Low**: Next major release
